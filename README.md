# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I explore the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles. This project is a personal deep dive into uncovering the highest-paying opportunities, the most in-demand skills, and where these two factors intersect within the field of data analytics.

Using real-world job posting data, I aimed to answer key questions that could guide my career development‚Äîand provide insights valuable to anyone entering the data field.

üîó Check out the SQL queries here: [Project_SQL](/Project_SQL/)
# Background
üìö This project was driven by my goal to better understand the data analyst job market. I wanted to uncover which skills are both highly paid and in demand, helping me tailor my learning and job search more effectively.

The dataset used in this analysis comes from Luke Barousse‚Äôs SQL Course, and includes job postings with details such as job titles, salaries, locations, and required technical skills.

Through SQL queries, I set out to answer the following key questions:

- What are the highest-paying data analyst jobs?

- What skills are required for those top-paying roles?

- Which skills are most frequently requested in the job market?

- Which skills are linked to higher average salaries?

- What are the most valuable skills to learn for maximizing marketability as a data analyst?
# Tools I Used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10 
```
üìä Here's the breakdown from the above query:

- üí∞ The highest-paying data analyst job offers a staggering salary of $650,000, listed by Mantys for a fully remote position.

- üè¢ High salaries aren‚Äôt limited to traditional analyst roles‚Äîtitles like Director of Analytics and Associate Director - Data Insights also rank among the top, highlighting leadership as a key salary driver.

- üåç All top-paying roles are remote, suggesting that flexible work arrangements are common in high-compensation positions for data analysts.

        job_postings_fact
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.job_id,
    top_paying_jobs.job_title,
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;
```

üìä Here's the breakdown from the above query:
